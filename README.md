# UnSupervised Learning
## Project: Identify Customer Segments

### Project Overview

This project works with real-life data provided by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. The main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. 

Code applies unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, the code assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.

### Need to install?

This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It is highly recommended to use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

NumPy
pandas
Sklearn / scikit-learn
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Seaborn (for data visualization)
